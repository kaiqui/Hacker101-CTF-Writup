# Hacker101 CTF Writeup

This document is a comprehensive writeup of the Hacker101 Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. The Hacker101 CTF is a series of security challenges and puzzles designed to help individuals improve their understanding of web security. The challenges are categorized into five difficulty levels: Trivial, Easy, Moderate, Hard, and Expert. Each section below contains a link to a folder with writeups for each level, offering detailed explanations and insights.

## Trivial Level

### Challenge 1:
- **Name**: A little something to get you started
- **Solution**: 

For the Trivial level, simply access the vulnerable web page and right-click to view the page source. You will see something like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            body {
                background-image: url("background.png");
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Welcome to level 0.  Enjoy your stay.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

The `style` tag indicates an image that is not displayed directly on the page but is linked via a URL. To retrieve the flag, you just need to navigate to the URL of the image file (in this case, "background.png").

The URL will look something like this: `https://ctf.hacker101.com/background.png`. When you navigate to this URL, the flag will be displayed in the following format:

```
^FLAG^10d3365ab6e67c30236167a974da9a77d4fa68d49fa5f47b4bcc804274052b51$FLAG$
```

This flag is the key piece of information you need to complete the Trivial level challenge.


## Easy Level
